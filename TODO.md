- [ ] Require passwords to be at least 20 characters long (no other requirements — no special characters, numbers, etc.)
- [ ] Make badges more fun — add icons and colors for each badge/tier
- [x] Add optional subtitle field to books
- [ ] Support multiple authors per book (change author from a single string to a related data structure)
- [ ] Allow logging reading sessions for past dates (not just today)
- [ ] Fix book cover image not displaying when added via URL
